# BufferOvfSuite
Repo for some buffer overflow tools I made. Each tool can be compiled with `gcc filename -o outputname` (Use the `-m32` flag for the 32 bit versions.)

Once compiled, the resulting egg will be a file named 'overflow', which can then be piped into the various scripts.
This project was for academic use on a project, but changing the scripts around a bit can make it a universal tool for 32 bit, 64 bit, or small buffer sizes.
